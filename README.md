- 👋 Hi, I’m @joelmalissa
- 👀 I’m interested in satellites 🛰️, aggregating government data, and juggling
- 🌱 I’m currently learning GitHub, JavaScript, and [645](https://juggle.fandom.com/wiki/645)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on government lists.  I.e. do you work for NOAA and want an acronyms tool?
